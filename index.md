# About Winter!

Winter Bot is a legal bot made for the game "GOT: Winter is coming" that can help players with a variety of functions on discord.

Winter Bot is made to help players with Protocol officers queuing, offline calculations , game server management, Bubble reminder, Rally calculators, Buff calculators, Pack calculators and etc! Its also going to have a bunch of very cool online games for discord servers!

Most of the functions are free! To be able to make up for the hardware resources and host cost of this bot, and for future development, some are only available for Patreons. Winter needs your help! Join me on this journey and help winter to become the best!
